answer to the question where can I add test users to the redshirt webapp

as far as Google is concerned, this web app is in test mode and we can only authenticate accounts registered as test users
this is an Google Auth Platform / Audience configuration and the test users can be found and updated at https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience?project=analyst-server
