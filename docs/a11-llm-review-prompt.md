# LLM Review Prompt: Gmail and Google Drive Integration Plan

You are an expert system architect specializing in Google API integrations, OAuth 2.0 implementations, and secure handling of user data. You've been asked to review a plan for integrating Gmail and Google Drive functionality into an existing web application. The plan aims to implement secure Gmail access for reading, labeling, and archiving emails, with the ability to periodically poll emails from outside the app. It also prepares for future Google Drive integration.

Please review the provided integration plan and assess its completeness, security measures, and overall feasibility. Consider the following aspects in your review:

1. OAuth Scope Selection: Are the chosen scopes appropriate for the described functionality? Are there any missing or unnecessary scopes?

2. Security Measures: Evaluate the proposed security measures for token storage, encryption, and handling. Are there any potential vulnerabilities or additional security steps that should be considered?

3. User Privacy and Consent: Assess the plan's approach to user consent and privacy. Are there any areas where user privacy could be further protected or where consent processes could be improved?

4. Implementation Steps: Review the outlined implementation steps. Are they comprehensive and in a logical order? Are there any critical steps missing?

5. Error Handling and Edge Cases: Evaluate the proposed error handling mechanisms. Are there any potential edge cases or error scenarios not addressed in the plan?

6. Scalability and Performance: Consider the scalability of the proposed solution, particularly for the periodic email polling feature. Are there any potential performance bottlenecks?

7. Compliance: Assess whether the plan adequately addresses compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

8. Integration with Existing Systems: Consider how well this plan integrates with the existing application architecture. Are there any potential conflicts or areas of concern?

9. Future-Proofing: Evaluate how well the plan prepares for future Google Drive integration. Are there any aspects that could be improved to make future expansions easier?

10. Best Practices: Identify any areas where Google API best practices or OAuth 2.0 best practices are not being followed.

Please provide a detailed review highlighting strengths of the plan, identifying any weaknesses or omissions, and offering specific recommendations for improvements. Your expertise will be crucial in ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly implementation of these Google service integrations.
