# Gmail and Google Drive Integration Plan

## OAuth 2.0 Scopes

We will request the following scopes during the Google Sign-In flow:

```
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
```

- `gmail.modify`: Allows reading, modifying, and archiving emails (but not deleting)
- `drive`: Full access to Google Drive files and folders
- `userinfo.email`: Retrieve user's email address

Note: `gmail.modify` does permit removing emails from the inbox and archiving them.

## Implementation Steps

1. Update OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud Console to include new scopes.
2. Modify Google Sign-In flow to request additional scopes.
3. Implement server-side token storage and encryption.
4. Create server-side functions for Gmail and Drive operations.
5. Implement client-side UI for Gmail/Drive interactions and permission management.
6. Develop error handling and re-authorization flows.

## Token Storage and Management

- Store encrypted refresh tokens in Firestore under a `user_tokens` collection.
- Implement server-side refresh token rotation and access token generation.
- Create functions to revoke access and delete stored tokens upon user request.

## Security Measures

- Encrypt all stored tokens.
- Use Firebase Security Rules to restrict access to token documents.
- Perform all sensitive operations (token refresh, API calls) server-side.

## User Permission Management

- Provide UI options for users to view current permissions and revoke access.
- Implement server-side logic to handle permission revocation requests.

## Compliance and Transparency

- Update privacy policy to reflect new data access and usage.
- Implement data deletion processes for revoked permissions and account deletions.

## Error Handling

- Develop robust error handling for token invalidation and API errors.
- Implement user notification system for authorization issues.

## Files to be Modified

```
// Client-side files
src/components/Header.jsx                 // Update sign-in button to request new scopes
src/lib/firebase/auth.js                  // Modify signInWithGoogle function
src/components/UserSettings.jsx           // New component for managing permissions
src/pages/dashboard.js                    // Add Gmail/Drive interaction components

// Server-side files
functions/index.js                        // New Firebase Functions for token management and API calls
functions/tokenEncryption.js              // Implement token encryption/decryption
functions/gmailOperations.js              // Functions for Gmail API calls
functions/driveOperations.js              // Functions for Drive API calls

// Configuration files
firebase.json                             // Update to include new Firebase Functions
firestore.rules                           // Add rules for user_tokens collection

// Documentation
README.md                                 // Update with new features and setup instructions
PRIVACY_POLICY.md                         // Update to reflect new data usage
```

## Next Steps

1. Begin by updating the OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud Console.
2. Modify the sign-in flow in the client-side application.
3. Develop server-side token storage and management functions.
4. Implement Gmail and Drive operation functions.
5. Create user interface components for new features.
6. Thoroughly test all new functionality, focusing on security and error handling.
7. Update documentation and privacy policy before deploying to production.

Remember to approach this implementation incrementally, testing each component thoroughly before moving to the next. Prioritize security at every step of the process.
