# Google Drive Viewer Integration Proposal

## Overview
This proposal outlines the integration of Google Drive Picker and Document Viewer into web-bumpy, enabling users to select and edit Google Drive documents directly within our application.

## Components

### 1. Google Drive Picker
- **Purpose**: Allow users to browse and select files from their Google Drive
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  // Google Picker API configuration
  const API_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_API_KEY
  const CLIENT_ID = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC__GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
  const SCOPE = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file']
  ```

- **Features**:
  - Browse personal Drive files
  - Multiple file type support (docs, sheets, PDFs)
  - Search functionality
  - Recent files view
  - Folder navigation

### 2. Document Viewer/Editor
- **Purpose**: Display and edit selected documents inline
- **Implementation**:
  ```html
  <!-- Viewer embed example -->
  <iframe 
    src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/{fileId}/edit?usp=drivesdk"
    allow="autoplay"
  ></iframe>
  ```

- **Features**:
  - Real-time editing
  - Commenting
  - Sharing controls
  - Version history
  - Mobile responsiveness

## Required OAuth2 Scopes
1. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`
   - Access to files created or opened by the app
2. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
   - Read-only access for file picker
3. `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.metadata.readonly`
   - Access file metadata

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
1. Update OAuth2 configuration
2. Implement Google Drive Picker
3. Add basic document viewer

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. Add document editing capabilities
2. Implement sharing controls
3. Add collaboration features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Offline support
2. Custom UI elements
3. Advanced permission management

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- OAuth2 token management
- Document access controls
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

### Performance
- Lazy loading for large documents
- Caching strategies
- Bandwidth optimization

### Limitations
1. **API Quotas**:
   - Daily API request limits
   - User quotas for real-time collaboration

2. **Browser Support**:
   - Modern browser requirements
   - Mobile browser limitations

3. **Feature Restrictions**:
   - Some features require Google Workspace
   - Editing limitations for certain file types

## User Experience

### File Selection
1. User clicks "Open from Drive" button
2. Google Drive Picker opens in modal
3. User selects document
4. Document loads in viewer/editor

### Document Editing
1. Document opens in embedded viewer
2. Real-time edits sync automatically
3. Changes save to Google Drive
4. Collaboration features available

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve OAuth2 scope requirements
2. Implement proof of concept
3. User testing and feedback
4. Phased rollout plan

## Questions to Consider
1. Do we need offline editing support?
2. Should we implement custom UI elements?
3. What level of collaboration features are needed?
4. How do we handle mobile responsiveness?
