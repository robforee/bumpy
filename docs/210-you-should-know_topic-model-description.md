# Topic Model Implementation Overview

## Core Components

1. **TopicPage (`src/app/topics/[id]/page.jsx`):**
   - Handles fetching and displaying individual topics
   - Uses client-side rendering with the "use client" directive
   - Fetches topic data using the `getTopicById` function
   - Renders the TopicEditor component

2. **TopicEditor Component (`src/components/TopicEditor.jsx`):**
   - Provides editing functionality for topics
   - Toggles between view and edit modes
   - Handles updates to topic title, subtitle, and text
   - Uses debounced saving for efficient updates

3. **Firestore Integration (`src/lib/firebase/firestore.js`):**
   - Contains functions for interacting with Firestore
   - Includes `getTopicById`, `updateDocument`, and other CRUD operations

4. **Firebase Client App (`src/lib/firebase/clientApp.js`):**
   - Initializes the Firebase app and exports the Firestore instance

## Authentication

The current implementation uses Firebase Authentication. Key points:

- Authentication state is managed at the app level
- The `db` instance from `clientApp.js` is used, which ensures authenticated access to Firestore
- Example of checking auth state:
  ```javascript
  const auth = getAuth();
  const user = auth.currentUser;
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in, proceed with authenticated operations
  } else {
    // No user is signed in, handle accordingly
  }
  ```

## Routing

- Next.js App Router is used for routing
- Dynamic routes are implemented for individual topics: `/topics/[id]`
- The `useParams` hook from `next/navigation` is used to access route parameters

## Data Flow

1. User navigates to a topic page
2. `TopicPage` component fetches topic data using `getTopicById`
3. Data is passed to `TopicEditor` for display and editing
4. Updates in `TopicEditor` are saved back to Firestore

## Extending the System

When extending the system, consider:

1. Maintaining the authentication flow using Firebase
2. Using the existing Firestore functions for data operations
3. Adhering to the Next.js App Router conventions for new pages and routes
4. Implementing client-side components with the "use client" directive where needed
5. Utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling new components

## Special Considerations

- Ensure proper error handling and loading states in new components
- Maintain consistent styling using Tailwind CSS classes
- Implement proper access controls in Firestore security rules for new collections or documents
- Consider performance implications of real-time listeners vs. one-time fetches for data
