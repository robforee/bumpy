# Authentication Upgrade Goals and Implementation Prompt

## Project Goals

1. Maintain existing Firebase Authentication for website login
2. Implement OAuth 2.0 server-side flow for long-term access to Google services (specifically Gmail)
3. Enable secure server-side Gmail querying
4. Allow client-side Gmail querying when appropriate
5. Ensure proper token management and security

## Key Requirements

1. User Authentication:
   - Preserve the current Google Sign-In flow using Firebase Authentication
   - Implement additional OAuth 2.0 consent flow for Gmail access during sign-in

2. Token Management:
   - Securely store refresh tokens on the server (Firestore)
   - Implement token refresh mechanism on the server
   - Handle token revocation and expiration gracefully

3. Server-side Gmail Access:
   - Create server endpoints (Next.js API routes or server actions) for Gmail operations
   - Implement server-side Gmail API calls using stored refresh tokens
   - Ensure proper error handling and rate limiting

4. Client-side Gmail Access:
   - Provide a mechanism for secure, temporary access token retrieval for client-side operations
   - Implement client-side Gmail API calls for immediate, user-initiated actions

5. Security:
   - Ensure all sensitive data (tokens, credentials) are properly secured
   - Implement proper authentication checks on all server endpoints
   - Follow principle of least privilege in all Gmail API interactions

## Implementation Considerations

1. Authentication Flow:
   - Modify the signInWithGoogle function to request offline access and necessary Gmail scopes
   - Implement a server endpoint to securely receive and store the refresh token

2. Token Storage:
   - Create a new Firestore collection for storing user refresh tokens
   - Implement proper security rules to restrict access to token data

3. Server-side Implementation:
   - Create a new module for handling Gmail API interactions
   - Implement functions for common Gmail operations (e.g., fetching emails, sending emails)
   - Use the Google APIs Node.js Client library for Gmail interactions

4. Client-side Implementation:
   - Create React hooks or functions for client-side Gmail operations
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states for Gmail operations

5. Background Jobs:
   - Consider implementing a background job system for periodic email checking or processing
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging in background jobs

6. Testing and Security:
   - Implement unit tests for new authentication and Gmail-related functions
   - Conduct security review of token handling and storage mechanisms
   - Test various scenarios including token expiration and revocation

## Next Steps

1. Review the current authentication implementation in detail
2. Create a detailed design document for the new authentication and Gmail access system
3. Identify any necessary changes to the existing codebase
4. Create a phased implementation plan, starting with server-side changes
5. Implement changes incrementally, with thorough testing at each stage
6. Update documentation and comments throughout the process
7. Conduct a final security review before deployment
