## Software Libraries and Versions

1. Next.js (v14.2.3) - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
2. React (v18.3.1) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
3. Firebase (v10.11.1) - Platform for building web and mobile applications
4. Firebase Admin (v12.1.0) - Server-side Firebase SDK
5. React Markdown (v9.0.1) - Markdown component for React
6. Server-only (v0.0.1) - Utility for server-side only code

## Design Patterns Used

1. Server-side Rendering (SSR) - Utilized through Next.js for improved performance and SEO
2. Component-based Architecture - React components are used throughout the application
3. Hooks - React hooks (useState, useEffect) are used for state management and side effects
4. Server Actions - Next.js server actions are used for server-side operations
5. Service Worker - Custom service worker for handling Firebase authentication
6. Modular File Structure - Separation of concerns with different files for actions, components, and Firebase configurations

## Authentication Scheme

1. Firebase Authentication - Used for user sign-in and management
2. Google Sign-In - Implemented as the primary authentication method
3. Custom Token Handling - Service worker manages Firebase ID tokens and Installation tokens
4. Server-side Authentication - getAuthenticatedAppForUser function in serverApp.js handles server-side auth
5. Role-based Access Control - Firestore rules implement basic access control based on user authentication
