3 body problem - swing-activities

intro:
the following document contains thoughts about a variety of ongoing projects, 
we want to gather all the concepts from this document into a hierarchical map of the various subjects found in this document

when structured all items fall under the root document.
some items are children of others as noted by the parent: tag in the bullet list and should be moved to it's proper parent when represented as a tree structure

all the organized subjects in this document when presented in a tree structure will be called the journal-structure object

each subject will use the subject-structure and has properties like  {parent, name, type, children}

create a journal-structure object showing the hierarchical subjects in this document.

return your response as a josn object

do-select-md:
list children of the root object

do-second:
2nd order children of the root object


xdo-first-gpt:

if it is not clear where in the hierarchy to put a concept, make you best guess or put it in a special property of root
each item has parent, name, type and children properties
parent and children properties are of the same object type

item-structure =  {parent, name, type, children}
parent and children are item-structured
Journal structure 
{root:{parent:none, 
   children: [
{ parent:root,type:"project", name: "Fix katie car",children:['Fix brakes","Fix door lock"] },
{ parent:root, type:"project",name: "Gather in new coop",children:['Furniture","Bicycles","Cookware"] }
{ parent:root, type:"strategy", name: "strategy",children:['Weekly focus","3 day sprints"] }
]
}}

types include project and strategy or any better descriptive terms

add a property root:msgs:[ list of refactoring recommendations to improve the organization of this object ]

add id numbers to each item do we can filter and select easily (unique by hierarchy)

xdo-each:
put them into a markdown document using headers for projects and bullets for contents
do not put results in a json object
