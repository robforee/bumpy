You are tasked with understanding and potentially extending a Next.js application that implements a Topic Model. The application uses Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data storage. Here are key aspects to keep in mind:

1. Component Structure:
   - The main components are TopicPage and TopicEditor.
   - TopicPage fetches data and renders TopicEditor.
   - TopicEditor handles both viewing and editing of topics.

2. Data Flow:
   - Topics are fetched from Firestore using the getTopicById function.
   - Updates are saved back to Firestore using the updateDocument function.
   - Real-time updates are not currently implemented but could be added.

3. Authentication:
   - Firebase Authentication is used.
   - The db instance from clientApp.js ensures authenticated Firestore access.
   - Example of checking auth state:
     ```javascript
     const auth = getAuth();
     const user = auth.currentUser;
     if (user) {
       // User is signed in
     } else {
       // No user is signed in
     }
     ```

4. Routing:
   - Next.js App Router is used.
   - Dynamic routes are implemented as `/topics/[id]`.
   - Use the useParams hook to access route parameters.

5. Styling:
   - Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
   - Ensure new components maintain consistent styling.

6. Extending the System:
   - When adding new features, maintain the existing authentication flow.
   - Use existing Firestore functions for data operations when possible.
   - Implement new pages and routes following Next.js App Router conventions.
   - Use the "use client" directive for client-side components.
   - Consider implementing real-time listeners for data that needs live updates.

7. Error Handling and Loading States:
   - Implement proper error handling in new components.
   - Provide clear loading states for asynchronous operations.

8. Security:
   - Ensure new Firestore operations are covered by appropriate security rules.
   - Never expose sensitive data or operations to unauthenticated users.

When extending this system, always consider the impact on performance, user experience, and data security. Maintain consistent coding practices and documentation for any new features or components added.
